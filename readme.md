# Hi!

This is just a small exercise to get working with Git and Github again.
# new changes have been made
I have no idea what typical chinese names are and how you'd write them.
So let's thake the extraordinary ones:
苏 莫婷 - Su Moting
沈清秋  - Shěn Qīngqiū


This should be in the master branch now.

This also concludes the 1hr lesson on Github for beginners.

Now I have changed something again, and need to  update to the GitHub Repo once again.
